## US-001 — Home screen is the Dialectics landing state with prompt bubbles
Status: PASS
Date: 2026-02-18

Implementation:
- Replaced HomeView dashboard with a Dialectics-first layout: prompt bubbles at top, compact recent items below, CaptureBarView inline with the Recent header
- Added PromptBubble model and PromptBubbleView component with hover state, label badge, prompt text, and arrow icon
- Heuristic bubble generator builds 2-3 bubbles based on: stale high-value items (30+ days), recent tag clusters (7-day window), contradiction connections; falls back to "Start a conversation" when knowledge base is empty
- Added groveStartConversationWithPrompt notification; tapping a bubble fires it with the prompt string
- ContentViewNotificationHandlers handles the notification: creates a new Conversation, immediately sends the prompt as the first user message via DialecticsService.sendMessage, then opens the chat panel
- Moved Suggestion/SuggestionType models to Views/Components/SuggestionModel.swift (was defined inline in HomeView but also used by BoardDetailView)
- Build passes with zero errors
